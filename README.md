tweet-dayone
============

A python script to add your tweets to the Day One journalling program for OS X


# Todo:
  * Incorporate timezone differences
  * Also include the original tweet if replying (done)? And retweets (check)? Favourited tweets (requires auth, I think)? Import pictures (done)? Imagining my voice is increasing in pitch with each subsequent question?
  * Should probably be using twitter's 1.1 api
  * Add options to disable photos, retweets, replies, etc
